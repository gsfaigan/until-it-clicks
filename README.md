# Sorting Algorithm VisualizerThis project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



An interactive visualization tool for 44 different sorting algorithms with real-time audio feedback and educational descriptions.## Available Scripts

## 🎯 Features### `npm start`



- **44 Sorting Algorithms** including classic, advanced, distribution, network, and novelty sortsRuns the app in the development mode.<br />

- **Real-time Audio Feedback** - Musical tones (110-660Hz) that change based on element valuesOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- **Visual Highlighting** - Color-coded bars showing comparisons, swaps, and sorted elements

- **Educational Descriptions** - Time complexity analysis and step-by-step explanationsThe page will reload if you make edits.<br />

- **Speed Control** - Adjustable visualization speedYou will also see any lint errors in the console.

- **Array Size Control** - Test with 10-200 elements

- **Pause/Resume/Stop** - Full control over visualization### `npm test`



## 🚀 Quick StartLaunches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

```bash

# Install dependencies### `npm run build`

npm install

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

# Run development serverIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm start

```The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

Your app is ready to be deployed!

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## 📦 Build for Production

### `npm run eject`

```bash

npm run build**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

```

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder ready for deployment.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

## 🎨 Algorithm Categories

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
